summary: encodes smart contracts function calls and decodes their output
description: |
  An Ethereum smart contract is bytecode, EVM, on the Ethereum blockchain.
  Among the EVM, there could be several functions in a contract. An ABI is
  necessary so that you can specify which function in the contract to invoke,
  as well as get a guarantee that the function will return data in the format
  you are expecting.
